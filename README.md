# WIP: Testing STAC catalogues

An experimental [STAC](https://stacspec.org/) catalogue that can be browsed using the [STAC Browser](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-browser).

This is a public repository so that its contents can be browsed directly with the STAC Browser. However, its contents are completely fictitious. This is just an experimental setup to help me learn about STAC.
